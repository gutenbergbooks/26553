<h3>TURANDOT: THE CHINESE SPHINX.</h3>

<h3><a name="ACT_I" id="ACT_I"></a>ACT I.</h3>


<p class="top5"><span class="smcap">SCENE</span>.&mdash;Outskirts of Peking. L. View of town gate, above which
are reared long poles, bearing turbaned and shorn heads, symmetrically
disposed so as to form a kind of architectural ornament.
R. Small suburban dwellings, from one of which issues <span class="smcap">PRINCE</span>
<span class="smcap">KALAF</span>, dressed in a fantastic Tartar warrior's costume.</p>


<p class="drama"><span class="name">KALAF.</span><br />
<br />
The Gods be thanked, at last by patient seeking,<br />
I've found a lodging in this crowded Peking.<br />
<br />
(Enter BARAK, in Persian costume; sees KALAF and starts, surprised.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
Prince Kalaf? 'tis not possible. He's dead!<br />
Yet, sure 'tis he&mdash;his eyes&mdash;his legs&mdash;his head,&mdash;<br />
My Lord!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KALAF.</span><br />
<br />
What&mdash;Barak! here&mdash;alive?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
And kicking.<br />
But how escaped you from that fatal licking<br />
The Bey of Tefflis gave us all in battle?<br />
Your father's troops were slaughtered off like cattle,<br />
And you, my Prince, we thought, were slain or taken;<br />
So off I fled to save, at least, <i>my</i> bacon.<br />
I found a refuge in this queer old city;<br />
A widow married me for love&mdash;or pity.<br />
We live like happy doves in yonder cot,&mdash;<br />
My only grief,&mdash;the thought of your sad lot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KALAF.</span><br />
<br />
We never thought to meet again, dear Tutor,&mdash;<br />
In China too!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
For years I've taken root here.<br />
But, dearest Prince, how was it, tell me, pray,<br />
You 'scaped the perils of that dreadful day?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Breathe not my name! A price is on my head;<br />
I've roamed from land to land; have toiled for bread.<br />
As slave I served the Shah of Keicobad;<br />
This King a fair and gracious daughter had,<br />
Who guessed my birth, and offered me her heart.<br />
Her haughty father bade me quick depart;<br />
With horse and arms he furnished me. I'm here<br />
T' enlist myself as Chinese volunteer;<br />
I hope to serve the Son of Moon and Stars<br />
In some crack regiment of Light Hussars.<br />
But what's the meaning of the crowds that flood<br />
Each caravanserah? Refused I stood<br />
By all, till in yon house I found, at least<br />
Accommodation for myself and beast.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
In that trim cottage lives my wife. 'Tis lucky<br />
She proved herself in house-letting so plucky.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KALAF.</span><br />
<br />
I give you joy, old friend; you're married snugly,<br />
Your wife (for a Chinese) is not so ugly,<br />
And kind as kind can be, though somewhat droll,<br />
Adieu,&mdash;I'll through the city take a stroll.<br />
And then proceed to visit the great Khan,<br />
And beg him to engage me as his man.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
Stay, Prince, how rash!&mdash;you do not know your danger:<br />
'Tis evident to Peking you're a stranger.<br />
To-day a horrid deed will be enacted,&mdash;<br />
A cruel death, by Turandot exacted.<br />
Have you not heard that Turandot the fair<br />
Has filled this land with bloodshed and despair?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KALAF.</span><br />
<br />
'Tis true I heard, in distant Keicobad,<br />
Accounts of Turandot, so strange, so sad,<br />
That I believed them false,&mdash;exaggerated.<br />
'Twas said the Prince of Keicobad, ill-fated,<br />
Had met his death by Turandot's command;<br />
His father, in revenge, assailed this land,<br />
But lost his life; my patroness, his daughter,<br />
By chance escaped unhurt the gen'ral slaughter,<br />
And slave was made to haughty Turandot:<br />
All this I heard, but credited it not.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
Too true is all you've heard through common rumour,<br />
The Princess Turandot's ferocious humour<br />
Has many princes caused to lose their life<br />
In seeking to obtain her as a wife.<br />
Her beauty is so wonderful, that all<br />
As willing victims to her mandate fall;<br />
In vain do various painters daily vie<br />
To limn her rosy cheek, her flashing eye,<br />
Her perfect form, and noble, easy grace,<br />
Her flowing ebon locks and radiant face.<br />
Her charms defy all portraiture: no hand<br />
Can reproduce her air of sweet command.<br />
Yet e'en such counterfeits, from foreign parts<br />
Attract fresh suitors,&mdash;win all hearts.<br />
But she, whose outward semblance thus appears<br />
To be Love's temple, such fierce hatred bears<br />
To all marital sway, or marriage tie,<br />
That rather than submit to man, she'd die.<br />
Great kings and princes, all have sued in vain,<br />
One glance of love or pity to obtain.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KALAF.</span><br />
<br />
In Keicobad I heard this oft-told tale,<br />
But thought it paradoxical&mdash;and stale.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
'Tis true. Her poor old father's in despair,<br />
For China's throne is now without an heir;<br />
He longs for her to wed some prince or other,<br />
And not perplex him with continual bother.<br />
He's of an age to live in peace and quiet,<br />
And not be plagued with wars and civil riot;<br />
He's tried all means his daughter's mind to soften,<br />
Has often sternly threatened&mdash;coaxed as often;<br />
Used prayers for such a monarch <i>infra dig</i>&mdash;<br />
But all in vain; she's headstrong as a pig.<br />
At length she said she'd make a compromise,<br />
The Khan consented&mdash;(he's not over-wise!)<br />
His artful daughter wheedled him to swear,<br />
By great Fo-hi, that she should never wear<br />
The hateful Hymeneal yoke, unless<br />
Some suitor for her hand should rightly guess<br />
Three difficult conundrums by herself composed:<br />
But if the man who for her hand proposed<br />
Should fail to solve her problems&mdash;then his pate<br />
Should be struck off, and grace the city-gate.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Why, what a tigress must this Princess be!<br />
I never heard such cruelty&mdash;Bless me!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
Already kings and princes by the dozen<br />
She's managed by her subtlety to cozen;<br />
For she's so clever that she always diddles<br />
The keenest wits by her confounding riddles.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KALAF.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
As wife, decidedly I should decline her,<br />
She's made of dragon-pattern stony China.<br />
What fools her suitors are, their hearts to fix on<br />
So termagant and bloodthirsty a vixen!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
So fascinating is she, none withstand her,<br />
All men for her do nothing but philander.<br />
Behold on yonder gate the ghastly row<br />
Of livid heads set up in dismal show.<br />
All these belonged to men who dared to hope<br />
With Turandot in subtlety to cope.<br />
To-day a prince is led to execution,<br />
Who failed to give her riddles due solution.<br />
That is the reason of the noise you hear,<br />
Pray go not to the town.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KALAF.</span><br />
<br />
What should I fear?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
The bloody spectacle your nerves might shake;<br />
The severed head is fastened to a stake.<br />
<br />
(<i>Gong sounds within the city watts.</i>)<br />
<br />
But hark! yon tantan's loud infernal dinning,<br />
Tells that the tragedy is now beginning.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KALAF.</span><br />
<br />
A monster like this princess should be strangled,<br />
Her body by wild horses torn and mangled.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
To all she is not cruelly inclined,<br />
'Tis Man she hates; to women she's most kind.<br />
Within her royal hareem serves my wife,<br />
And with her mistress leads a happy life.<br />
The only fault of Turandot is pride,&mdash;<br />
Her many virtues cannot be denied.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Who comes this way?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
'Tis Ishmael, the friend<br />
Of him who just has met his tragic end.<br />
<br />
<i>Enter</i> ISHMAEL, <i>weeping</i>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ISH.</span><br />
<br />
His life is o'er! Ah, would the cruel knife<br />
Had struck my worthless self, and spared his life.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
Bear up, good friend, I pity you sincerely,<br />
Your master for his love has paid too dearly.<br />
Why did you not dissuade him from the trial&mdash;<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ISH.</span><br />
<br />
My prayers he met with kind, but firm denial.<br />
His dying words still echo in mine ear&mdash;<br />
"Good friend," he said, "to die I do not fear;<br />
My life's a blank if without <i>her</i> I live.<br />
Speed to my father,&mdash;beg him to forgive<br />
His hapless son, who staked his life on one<br />
Whose face is fair, whose heart is cold as stone.<br />
Shew him this portrait: (<i>takes a miniature from his<br />
breast</i>) when its charms he views,<br />
My frenzied love, my rashness he'll excuse."<br />
This said, he clasped the portrait to his breast,<br />
Fond kisses on its icy beauty pressed;<br />
Then bent his head, and closed his eyes,<br />
The death blow fell, and sent him to the skies.<br />
<br />
(<i>Dashes the portrait to the ground.</i>)<br />
<br />
Away, thou false deceit! thou cause of woe,<br />
Th' original I'd trample even so.<br />
To dust I'd grind her tiger heart;&mdash;her soul,<br />
I'd send to Eblis' region dark and foul! (<i>Exit</i>.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
Are you convinced?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KALAF.</span><br />
<br />
I'm perfectly amazed.<br />
How can a painted semblance thus have crazed<br />
So sensible a prince? (<i>Stoops to pick it up.</i>)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
For heaven's sake,<br />
Avoid that picture as you would a snake.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KALAF</span> (<i>smiling</i>).<br />
<br />
No harm will happen, dear old tutor, sure<br />
From picking up a picture from the floor.<br />
No woman yet has caused my heart to throb,&mdash;<br />
Shall painted lines my soul of freedom rob?<br />
<br />
(<i>Barak endeavours to prevent Kalaffrom beholding<br />
the miniature; Kalaf puts him aside, and gazes<br />
on it for some time in silence.</i>)<br />
<br />
Ye gods! an angel's face. Oh ecstacy!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
Now, there; he's caught. I knew how it would be!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KALAF.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Beneath this beaming smile, these lustrous eyes,<br />
There cannot lurk a cruel heart of ice.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I tell you she's the wickedest of creatures;<br />
Oh, gaze not on the Syren's fatal features,<br />
More baneful than the Gorgon head, Medusa.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Hush, hush, I will not hear you thus abuse her,<br />
I never saw a face and form diviner;<br />
Her's is not mortal clay, but porcelain China,<br />
Some magic power, some demon, I know not,<br />
Enchains my soul to beauteous Turandot.<br />
<br />
(<i>Gazes enraptured on the miniature.</i>)<br />
<br />
These eyes to meet, these rosy lips to kiss,<br />
Who would not hazard all to win such bliss?<br />
My senses reel, my veins are all afire!<br />
Good Barak, help me to my heart's desire.<br />
Her stern ordeal I'll undergo&mdash;to solve<br />
Her problems or to die, is my resolve.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
Desist from your intention, I conjure you,<br />
Let my remonstrance of this madness cure you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KALAF.</span><br />
<br />
You speak in vain. My fortune now or never,<br />
Shall be ensured for aye, or lost for ever.<br />
One stroke will end my life, or I shall gain<br />
The fairest woman e'er beheld, and reign<br />
An Emperor of Chang's celestial state.<br />
O smile upon my hopes, benignant Fate!<br />
<br />
(<i>During this speech, a Chinese executioner has<br />
appeared on the city gate, bearing a pole upon<br />
which is fixed a turbaned head: he places it in<br />
the row, and disappears.</i>)<br /><br />
But tell me, Barak, shall I in divan<br />
Behold the lovely daughter of the Khan?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
A spectacle more thrilling now behold,<br />
That head just smitten off. My blood runs cold,<br />
To think that yours may be thus closely shaven.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Nay, fear is not for princes&mdash;I'm no craven.<br />
<br />
(<i>Contemplates the head with compassion.</i>)<br />
<br />
Poor youth, deserving of a better fate.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
Sweet prince, renounce th' attempt.<br />

I fear you'll fail to guess the Sphinx's riddles.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I'll cut the Gordian knots right down their middles!<br />
I'm not so stupid as some folks suppose;<br />
'Twill not be easy my quick wit to pose.<br />
I fancy I shall come off with <i>&eacute;clat</i>;<br />
But if I fail, it does not matter, pshaw!<br />
If in this enterprise I lose my life,<br />
Present my compliments to your good wife;<br />
My horse be hers, in payment of her trouble.<br />
Heigho! this world's a dream, and life's a bubble!<br />
<br />
(<i>Going. Enter</i> SKIRINA <i>from the cottage.</i>)<br />
<br />
Reveal my name to none. Nay, do not cry,<br />
You've wept me once before as dead. Goodbye.<br />
<br />

<br />
Why, what's the matter? You are melancholy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
Oh, help me, wife, restrain this youth's mad folly;<br />
He's off to Peking&mdash;means to dare the Sphinx!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">SKIR.</span><br />
<br />
He's sure to die&mdash;my heart within me sinks!<br />
What put such silly nonsense in your head?<br />
You've got brain fever; bless you, go to bed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Pray save your breath. My fever needs no nurse<br />
But Turandot's fair hand. Here, take my purse,<br />
I have no farther need of money; for<br />
I either die, or shall become an Emperor.<br />
<br />
(<i>Exit hastily into the city gate.</i>)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK</span> (<i>following him</i>).<br />

Dear master, hear me; stay; all, all in vain;<br />
I ne'er shall see his bless&egrave;d face again!<br />

You know my stranger-guest? how very funny,<br />
Let's try to catch him, and return his money.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BARAK.</span><br />
<br />
Wife, be not curious; no questions ask,<br />
He's gifted with such mental powers, the task<br />
Of coping with the Sphinx he may achieve&mdash;<br />
His doom unto the gods we now must leave.<br />
<br />

We'll sacrifice a pig to great Fo-hi,<br />
He'll perhaps contrive your handsome friend shan't die.<br />

How humble was his suit&mdash;how mild and good,<br />
How unresentful towards my scornful mood.<br />

I dread the world's disdain&mdash;its scoffing taunt.<br />
My people shall not see Turandot fall,<br />
The slave of one means abject slave to all.<br />

<br />
Just three o'clock! by Kong's pagoda-chimes.<br />
You've paced this floor just twice three hundred times.<br />
Your Highness had much better go to sleep.<br />
You'll have to rise with dawn's first ruddy peep.<br />
I can't watch any more; my eyelids close.<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KALAF</span>.
<br />
<br />Thou'rt right, Brighella; go to thy repose.<br />
<br />
(BRIG. going, returns cautiously.)<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BRIG</span>.<br />
<br />
One word, your Highness,&mdash;when I've left my post,<br />
Don't be astonished if you see a ghost.<br />
You understand? You needn't be afraid;<br />
I daren't say more; my silence is prepaid.<br />
Forewarned, forearmed, you know. To a blind horse<br />
A nod's as good as twenty winks, of course.<br />
<br />

<br />
What spectres shall I see? what dreary sprite?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">BRIG.</span><br />
<br />
Oh, nothing, (<i>yawns</i>.) I'm <i>so</i> sleepy, Prince, good night.<br />
<br />
(<i>Going, returns.</i>)<br />
<br />
I hope you are not angry with Brighella&mdash;<br />
I'm but a poor, ill-paid, hardworking fellah&mdash;<br />
The Emperor has ordered that no fly<br />
Shall enter this apartment&mdash;you know why;<br />
But tho' he's king, his daughter really rules.<br />
It's hard to keep one's balance 'twixt two stools!<br />
And what a woman wills, for good or evil.<br />
That must be done, or she will play the devil.<br />
<br />
(<i>Going, returns.</i>)<br />
<br />
Mind, <i>I</i> know nothing. Keyholes may suffice;<br />

<br />
Good night, and thanks; your hint I comprehend.<br />
Will treachery be used my life to end?<br />
Nay, Turandot's too noble&mdash;I'll not fear.<br />
The fateful hour approaches (<i>opens a casement</i>.)<br />
Dawn is near,<br />
I'll seek to drown my care in dreamy rest.<br />

<br />
What, don't you know Skirina? (<i>takes off the beard</i>.)<br />
I'm so frightened!<br />
Disguised I've passed your guards, in these clothes tightened.<br />
I've got so much to tell. Your poor old tutor<br />
Is put in chains! Yes, nothing less would suit her.<br />
He's anxious for your life&mdash;he begs you'll sign<br />
Your name to show you're safe; just write one line<br />
To pacify him; or he'll all declare;<br />
The Princess Turandot's in such a flare.<br />
I tremble for my husband,&mdash;he's demented,<br />
Until you've kindly to his wish consented.<br />
I've brought a tablet&mdash;just your name indite<br />
To ease his mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KAL.</span> (<i>takes the tablet</i>.)<br />
<br />
To please him, I will write.<br />
<br />
(<i>Suddenly recollects himself, and looks at her searchingly.</i>)<br />

Skirina, would'st thou traitress turn? Thy guest I've been.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">SKIR.</span> (<i>aside</i>.)<br />
<br />
I promised I would do my best.<br />
But such reproaches down I cannot gulp,<br />
Not if my mistress beat me to a pulp.<br />
So Miss Adelma may play off her tricks<br />
Herself, (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">KALAF</span>.) Please don't your eyes thus on me fix.<br />
(<i>whimpering</i>.) I should have thought some slight consideration<br />
You would have felt for my sad situation.<br />
If you suspect me.<br />
<br />

Nay, I'm sure you acted<br />
All out of kindness.<br />

<br />
Speak on, good vision; I am all attention.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
T'explain in plainest words is my intention.<br />
The keeper of the Hareem stands before you!<br />
But that's not here nor there; so I'll not bore you<br />
With all my titles. The Princess Turandot<br />
Right thro' the heart by Cupid's dart is shot!<br />
I would not flatt'ringly your Highness flatter<br />
With mincing terms, nor will I mince the matter.<br />
My mistress is distracted to&mdash;distraction<br />
By your attractive personal&mdash;attraction.<br />
If truth I speak not, may the high Fo-hi<br />
Grind all my bones to make his next meat-pie!<br />

<br />
So far, so good; what hast thou more to say?<br />

<br />
Be not impatient, Royal Highness, pray.<br />
My mistress is a tiger-cat&mdash;(permit<br />
The term; tho' coarse, 'tis graphically fit.)<br />
She gnashes her white teeth with frantic ire,<br />
And raves against you, "Robbers, murder, fire!"<br />
If truth I speak not, may the high Fo-hi<br />
Make mince-meat of me for his sacred pie.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KAL.</span><br />

No need of oaths. But hast thou not, good keeper,<br />
Some better news to tell a waken'd sleeper?<br />
<br />
<br />
Truf.<br />
<br />
Of course I have. Without circumlocution<br />
I now proceed to instant elocution:<br />
My charming mistress sent me here to beg<br />
You'll trust her with your secret. Her last leg<br />
She's standing on; and in sheer desperation<br />
She'll marry you; but must before the nation<br />
Appear to vanquish you&mdash;in mere appearance.<br />
Be quick, and of your secret make a clearance.<br />
Clear up the matter, and I'll then clear out;<br />
My time is precious. Finish off this bout.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KAL.</span><br />
<br />
One thing thou hast forgotten.<br />
<br />

<br />
What have I?<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KAL.</span><br />
<br />
To imprecate thy bones to Fo-bi's pie.<br />
Return to Turandot. Tell her from me<br />
She'll glorious shine in high divan, if she<br />
Benignant prove herself; more true distinction<br />
She'll gain by this, than by my hope's extinction.<br />

I shall not fail. In vain was their endeavour,<br />
But I will venture all, the knot to sever.<br />
I may not learn his name,&mdash;but I'll implore<br />
His flight from Peking. Then my love, once more<br />
May hope to win his heart.<br />
<br />
(<i>Unveils, and gazes upon him.</i>)<br />
<br />
He gently slumbers:<br />
Reluctantly I rouse him, but time numbers<br />
The hours yet left for action. Prince, arise!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KAL.</span><br />
<br />
Who calls? Another spirit! Do my eyes<br />
Deceive me? Can it be? Adelma here?<br />
Thy royal person in a slave's mean gear!<br />
Such lowly garb is surely some disguise.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADEL.</span><br />
<br />
No, Prince; Adelma now in slav'ry sighs.<br />
Beneath the galling yoke of her who martyred<br />
My wretched brother, and my father slaughtered.<br />
Not you alone must suffer from the curse<br />
Of Turandot's fell ire; my fate's far worse.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KAL.</span><br />
<br />
Princess, believe me; more your lot I mourn<br />
Than e'en my own. So fair, so nobly born,<br />
So gracious to th' unhappy;&mdash;I can ne'er<br />
Forget your kindness to myself. If e'er<br />
In need of faithful service you may stand,<br />
Which I may render in return, command<br />
Me as your slave. My gratitude's eternal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADEL.</span><br />
<br />
From Turandot I'd save you. Her infernal<br />
Devices throw a glamour o'er your senses:<br />
But did you know her shallow, false pretences,<br />
Of her great excellence you'd scorn the notion,<br />
Nor waste on her your noble heart's devotion.<br />
For all she sets up as a learned Sphinx,<br />
She's nothing but a sly, conceited minx.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KAL.</span><br />
<br />
Nay, blame not her, but adverse destiny,<br />
Your brother willed his death; the choice was free.<br />
Your father fell in battle&mdash;'twas ill-fate<br />
Awarded death, not she. Oh, do not hate<br />
Your mistress; surely she your worth esteems<br />
And treats you as your gentle birth beseems.<br />
To-morrow, if I'm victor as before<br />
I'll freedom give you, and your throne restore.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADEL.</span><br />
<br />
Can nothing your credulity convince?<br />
Oh, fly this wicked woman, dearest Prince.<br />
Escape with me! Come haste! Our time is short;<br />
I've bribed your guards. We'll sail from the next port<br />
To Keicobad&mdash;there all will hail me Queen.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KAL.</span><br />
<br />
Farewell, Princess; magnanimous you've been.<br />
Escape alone. To die I am content,<br />
You cannot turn me from my firm intent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADEL.</span><br />
<br />
Ungrateful man! Then learn the horrid truth.<br />
The heart of Turandot can feel no ruth.<br />
You've foiled her cunning. Fear her tiger-spring.<br />
To-morrow as you pass to join the King<br />
In high divan,&mdash;her slaves, with stealthy blow,<br />
Will pierce your heart;&mdash;your life will be laid low.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Oh, hapless Kalaf! must thy life thus end?<br />
In exile perish&mdash;far from ev'ry friend!<br />

Prepare the altar.<br />
<br />
(<i>A curtain is raised, disclosing an altar with a Chinese deity.<br />
Two priests attending.</i>)<br />
<br />
Hither call our daughter;<br />
Obedience to the law shall now be taught her.<br />
Set open all the doors! Lo, where she comes.<br />
<br />
(<i>A slow march is heard.</i> <span class="smcap">TRUFFALDIN</span> <i>and slaves enter, in mourning<br />
garments, with weepers of crape attached to their pigtails.</i> <i>Female<br />

<br />
Is this a wedding march, with muffled drums?<br />
It sounds more like a dead march, dull and dreary&mdash;<br />
The one in "Saul," or Verdi's <i>Miserere</i>.<br />
Her sulky Highness looks as black as thunder<br />
At having thus in public to knock under.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TUR.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">KALAF</span>).<br />
<br />
This sad procession, Prince <i>Incognito</i><br />
Profound humiliation is to show.<br />
Your arrogance upon my shame will gloat,&mdash;<br />
Your eyes on your defeated slave will doat.<br />
I see the altar&mdash;Fo-hi's grand official<br />
Prepared to bind the victim sacrificial.<br />
My glory's dead&mdash;disgraced is Turandot!<br />
Condemned to wear the chain of Hymen's knot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KAL.</span><br />
<br />
Oh, couldst thou know how deeply I revere<br />
Thy maiden dignity, not thus severe<br />
Thoud'st show thyself, nor my fond love resent.<br />
As slave to thee my whole life shall be spent;<br />
But deign one gracious sign to give, that thou<br />
In time, responsive tenderness mayst know.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ALT.</span><br />
<br />
Prince, condescend no more. Commence the rite!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TUR.</span><br />
<br />
One moment more. (<i>Sarcastically</i>.) I am not ready, quite.<br />
<br />
(<i>Rises and addresses</i> <span class="smcap">KALAF</span>)&mdash;<br />
<br />
I raised your hopes, that they might deeper fall.<br />
Prince Kalaf, Son of Timur, quit this hall<br />
And China's realm. Go, seek another bride.<br />
In vain my penetration you defied;<br />
No secret's hidden from the Chinese Sphinx.<br />

Dear me, what is the matter?<br />
I cannot hear thro' all this general chatter.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I shan't attempt just now to make him hear;<br />
I'm dazed myself, and his head's <i>never</i> clear.<br />

My overloving heart has caused my woe,<br />
I gave up all, to please my lovely foe.<br />
If yesterday I purposely had failed<br />
To win the day, or from the contest quailed,<br />
My soul had now found rest. Ah, why<br />
Altoum, wert thou too merciful? To die<br />
To-day, if conquered, should have been my meed&mdash;<br />
Great Emperor, thus shouldst thou have decreed.<br />
<br />
<br />

His grief affects me deeply; strangely new<br />
Emotions swell my bosom.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">SKIR.</span><br />
<br />
Put an end<br />
To trifling. Far as Jericho I'd send<br />
All shilly-shally. Do, for goodness' sake<br />
Speak out and say, "As husband I thee take."<br />
I've married twice, and know how shy one feels&mdash;<br />
<br />
Plunge in at once, right over head and heels.<br />
A royal Crown Prince, too; my stars and garters!<br />
<i>Cr&ecirc;me de la cr&ecirc;me</i>&mdash;the cream of Crimean Tartars!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ADELMA.</span><br />
<br />
My soul by doubt and hate is torn;<br />
She loves him, though she shows such bitter scorn.<br />
I'm stung to anguish, yet I'll not repine,<br />
My rival's torture is as sharp as mine.<br />
<br />
(<span class="smcap">KALAF</span> <i>has stood bowed down by grief; he starts suddenly and<br />

<br />

<br />
Thy cruel will shall find no more resistance;<br />
Why need the headsman end my sad existence?<br />
This dagger shall release....<br />
<br />
(<i>Unsheathes a dagger.</i> <span class="smcap">ADELMA</span> <i>makes a movement of horror.</i><br />

Or strike thy heart through mine.<br />

time</i>.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KAL.</span><br />
<br />
Wouldst doom me to a life, of love bereft?<br />
My hopes and joys all faded&mdash;nothing left.<br />
Such mercy seeks more cruelly to kill;<br />
But my despair is stronger than thy will.<br />
<br />
(<i>Attempts to stab himself.</i>)<br />
<br />
<br />
Tur.<br />
<br />
For my sake, live; nor ever quit my side;<br />
Prince, take me as your loving, happy bride.<br />

Don't speak. I <i>see</i> all's right.<br />

<br />
Fo-hi be praised! Now, this is what I call<br />
A great success. My pig has done it all.<br />
<br />
(<i>Fetches</i> <span class="smcap">BARAK</span> <i>from behind the crowd</i>)&mdash;<br />
<br />
Come, dearest husband; much too long you've trembled.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">TUR.</span><br />
<br />
Let it be known to all those here assembled&mdash;<br />
I may not justly claim the victor's crown,<br />
Adelma's shrewdness served me; not my own.<br />
Prince Kalaf vanquished me, and may command<br />
As prize of his achievement, my poor hand.<br />
(<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">KALAF</span>.) But not in deference to lawful right<br />
I gave myself to thee, but through love's might.<br />
My heart was thine, when first I did behold thee.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">KALAF.</span><br />
<br />
Excess of bliss, thus to my heart to fold thee!<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="name">ALT.</span><br />
<br />
What do they say? You all make such a noise,<br />
I can't hear anything&mdash;not my own voice.<br />
No doubt it's quite correct, nay, sentimental;<br />
So take my blessing and consent parental.<br />
